# Analysis-of-Mental-Health-Survey
Data Visualization and Analysis of Mental Health in Tech Industries Survey (2014)

## Aim
The main objective of this project is to visualise the data collected through this survey in many interactive plots and derive various interesting insights. This would help gain a more better understanding about the importance of mental health in Tech industries and also enables us to understand the various measures taken by them. This would aid in developing new strategies for promoting mental health efficiently in the Tech industries.

## About the Dataset 
The dataset used is originally put together from a survey which was conducted by Open Sourcing Mental Illness (OSMI) Organization in the year 2014. According to OSMI, this survey was “the largest survey done on mental health in the tech industry” in the year 2014. This dataset projects different opinions of people towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace.
